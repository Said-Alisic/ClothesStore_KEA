**Things to note**
- Trying to sign in with a user created from the population scripts will not work due to the password hashing mechanism of the API user creation controller
- To sign in, add a new user with the Postman API testing application

**Data to use with Postman to sign in**
1. POST a new user to the API route http://localhost:8080/api/users
    {
        "role_id": 3,
        "first_name": "new",
        "last_name": "user",
        "email": "newuser@gmail.com",
        "password": "newpass"
    }
2. POST sign in credentials to sign in with the new user at http://localhost:8080/api/users/signin
    {
        "email": "newuser@gmail.com",
